        <h1>Annual spring flooding raises long-term solution concerns</h1>
        <h2>Mitigating flooding events in the Canadian landscape will have to change in a world of climate unrest</h2>

    <p>After a cold and snowy winter most Canadians look forward to the spring thaw - and for the possibility of flooding. The Ottawa area is no stranger to flood watches due to the proximity to both the Ottawa River, the Gatineau River, and adjacent tributaries. Spring often begins with public safety alerts from both the <a href="https://ottawa.ca/en" target="_blank">City of Ottawa</a> and the <a href="https://www.gatineau.ca/portail/default.aspx?p=accueil" target="_blank">Ville de Gatineau</a>, and this year was no different.</p>

    <p>While the annual cycle of spring thaw and flooding isn’t new to many Canadians, the increase in both intensity and frequency of flooding due to climate change is. In a report published in March of 2020, the United Nations Environment Programme outlines the connection between climate change and flood events.</p>

    <p role="textbox" aria-multiline="true" aria-label="Pullquote text" contenteditable="true" class="block-editor-rich-text__editable rich-text" style="white-space: pre-wrap; min-width: 1px;"><strong data-rich-text-format-boundary="true">“Floods are made more likely by the more extreme weather patterns caused by long-term global climate change. Change in land cover - such as removal of vegetation - and climate change increase flood risk.”</strong></p>
        <cite role="textbox" aria-multiline="true" aria-label="Pullquote citation text" class="block-editor-rich-text__editable wp-block-pullquote__citation rich-text" contenteditable="true" style="display: block; white-space: pre-wrap; min-width: 1px;">UN Environment Programme</cite>

    <p>Simply put, with higher temperatures the earth’s atmosphere holds more water and subsequently pours out that water leading to an increase in flood events. A study published in 2016 regarding the massive flooding in Louisiana at the time outlines that “warming due to greenhouse gases has made - conservatively - events like the one in August at least 40% more likely and 10% more intense.”</p>

    <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration details that the earth’s average temperature in 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records started being kept in 1880. In the 143 year period since then, the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2010, with a “roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature” occurring since the pre-industrial era.</p>

    <p>All of this points to both an increase in flood frequency as well as in intensity, and at a-typical times of the year to which we’ve become accustomed to. Spring flooding may occur earlier or later than past averages as a result of more extreme weather events such as heavy rain and snow storms, or early heat waves which melt snow packs and glaciers both quicker and earlier than normative.</p>

    <p>The reality of these events becoming more frequent has many researchers diving into how we can better adapt ahead of time, and advocating for a longer view in terms of risk reduction and climate change adaptation.</p>

    <p>Partners for Action is an initiative at the University of Waterloo “that seeks to empower Canadians to become flood resilient by promoting awareness and preparedness actions that are inclusive and evidence-based”. P4A advocates for long term solutions, encouraging policy makers to develop “flood resilience planning and foresight.”</p>

    <p>One strategy that P4A has presented is the notion of “managed retreat” or “strategic retreat”.</p>

    <p>Shaieree Cottar, Coordinator with the Canadian Coastal Resilience Forum and a researcher with the P4A group, describes managed retreat as an “act of purposeful relocation of assets, people, and property from the highest risk areas.”</p>

    <p>In response to the 2017 and 2019 floods, the province of Quebec utilised this strategy, enacting a property buyout program to those that were affected by the floods. While it can be an effective tool to support those who have experienced flooding, there are some caveats.</p>

    <p>Cottar shared that in her research it was found that people are reluctant to leave their homes, even when they’ve experienced multiple flood events. While there are a variety of reasons people are hesitant to leave, often finances are the deciding factor. Even with a $250,000 buyout, as offered by the Quebec government in 2019, the reality of the Canadian housing market is that that amount simply won’t cover a new mortgage. A main critique of the practice of managed retreat is that governments need to offer buyouts that are competitive with the Canadian housing market.</p>

    <p>The reality of climate change and how it applies to everyday lives is an issue that the Canadian federal government continues to grapple with. While the government has deemed overland flooding to be Canada’s costliest hazard, there hasn’t been much on-the-ground-action thus far.</p>

    <p>In a report filed by the Climate Institute of Canada, Ryan Ness, Adaptation Research Director, and Sarah Miller, Senior Research Associate, write that “Canada has lagged behind other countries in developing an integrated, country-wide strategy to respond to the impacts of climate change. Many of our peer nations are now on their second or third versions of adaptation strategies and corresponding implementation plans.”</p>

    <p>Ness notes that while the 2023 federal budget has significant funding under the National Adaptation Strategy allocated to tackle climate change, we first need comprehensive flood zone mapping - a goal which has been included in the NAS and is, as Ness puts it, "a good first step."</p>

    <p>In a March 2023 interview with Global News, Ness also says that the $31.7 million allocated towards a national flood insurance program is a good starting place.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, there is a still lot of work to be done before Canada is climate change ready.</p>
